# MyPrivateStudy-DjangoTutorial
A practice; derived from 'LocalLibrary' tutorials on MDN web docs for Django framework. Instead of the books in a library, I'll write down my own study notes, and manage them in my personal study; such a place that the nobles might have in their home. ðŸ™„

## [NOTE]
* Due to naming convention of Django, after cloning the project from repository, the project root path must change the hyphen('-') to underscore('_').
